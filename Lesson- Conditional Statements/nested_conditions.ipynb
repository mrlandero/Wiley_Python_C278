    "## Concept 1: Elif\n",
    "Python uses the **```elif```** keyword as a contraction of \"else if\", which allows us to string together many different conditions, each of which must be True or False on their own. The syntax looks like:<br>\n",
    "**```if condition1:```**<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**```instruction1```**<br>\n",
    "**```elif condition2:```**<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**```instruction2```**<br>\n",
    "**```elif condition3:```**<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**```instruction3```**<br>\n",
    "**```else:```**<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**```instruction#```**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While the construction must include at least one elif statement, it can contain as many as necessary to address all the positional conditions.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating this structure, Python does the following:<br>\n",
    "1. If **```conditional1```** is True, Python executes **```instruction1```** and skips the rest of the code in the structure.<br>\n",
    "2. If **```conditional1```** is False, Python evaluates the **```elif```** statements individually until it finds a condition that is True. It then executes the instructions for that **```elif```** statement and skips the rest of the code in the structure.<br>\n",
    "3. If none of the conditions is True, Python executes the instructions in the **```else```** block."
