    "## Concept 1: Basic Conditional Statements\n",
    "In every programming language, it is important to be able to execute an appropriate block of code depending on some condition. That is the purpose of conditional statements. Python supports a variety of conditional statements.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **```if```** statement creates a basic conditional statement that executes a block of code if a condition is true, using the syntax:<br>\n",
    "**```if condition:```**<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**```statement```**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "where **```condition```** is a statement that can evaluate to either True or False. If the condition evaluates as True, Python will execute the statement that follows. If the condition evaluates as False, Python will skip that statement and go on to the next set of instructions.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, we want to test if the condition False rather than only testing for True. For this reason, we often explicitly state the outcome of the condition. For example, we can use the following statement if we explicitly want to test for True:<br>\n",
    "**```if condition == True:```**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Or we can use the following variation when we want to test for False:<br>\n",
    "**```if condition == False```**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We frequently use flowcharts to create a visual representation of the steps a program will follow when there is an if-statement, using a diamond to represent the condition. The diamond normally has one input, a question that evaluates to Yes (True) or No (False), with one output for each possibility.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Flowchart](flowchart.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not have to use flowcharts if you don't want to, but they can be very useful to help you step through a program, both before you start to write the code and to troubleshoot programs that produce unexpected results. "
