    "When we use a simple **```if```** statement, we evalaute a single condition and produce an outcome based on the state of that condition. While we can include a series of **```if```** statements (and even build complex conditions by comparing individaul **```if```** conditions), this approach has the disadvantage that Python will evaluate each statement as it goes through the code, even if only one of the statements can logically be True.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to use an **```if-else```** statement instead of two (or more) individual **```if```** statements. The advantage of **```if-else```** is that the **```else```** part of the statement will be evaluated only if the **```if```** condition is not met. If the initial condition is met, Python can skip the remaining code in the block, which can help speed up the runtime of the code. However, a standard **```if-else```** block supports only two outcomes: one for situations where the condition is True and the other for where the condition is False."

    "\n",
    "While we could use two separate **```if```** statements to compare the values, the **```if-else```** structure allows us to state the comparison exactly one time. If the values are the same, Python will display the \"if-True\" response and skip over the **```else```** portion of the statement. If the initial **```if```** statement is false, Python skips the instructions in that block and goes straight to the **```else```** block to execute the instructions there. "
